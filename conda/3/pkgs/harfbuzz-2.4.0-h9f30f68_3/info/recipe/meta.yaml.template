# Note: in conda-forge.yml we currently disable the beta-testing of Azure
# Pipelines. This is because the Windows image we use on Azure provides Visual
# Studio 2017, whereas on AppVeyor we need VS2015. Since AppVeyor is what
# actually gets deployed, it wins for now. If/when we're ready to switch over
# to Azure for production, the VS version requirement should bump up to 2017.
# (Or maybe at that point there will be a mechanism to use VS2015 in Azure
# Pipelines.)
