  summary: "Simple message bus system for applications to talk to one another"
  description: |
    D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications
    to talk to one another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps
    coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a "single
    instance" application or daemon, and to launch applications and daemons on
    demand when their services are needed.
