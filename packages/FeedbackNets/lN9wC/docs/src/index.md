# FeedbackConvNets.jl Docs

Welcome to the documentation of FeedbackConvNets.jl.

FeedbackConvNets is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package based on
[Flux](https://fluxml.ai/) that implements recurrent connections between
different layers of a deep network. This makes it possible to have feedback
connections from higher/later layers in the networks to lower/earlier layers.
