# Why.jl

Provides a single function `why()` which returns a randomly generated String giving an explanation. Example outputs:

`"Because some harmless and properly type-safe cockatoo and the fast type pirate decided so."`

`"Some deceitful and vaguely self aware person and the programmer wanted it."`

`"Some not at all self aware and very self aware compiler and some deceitful research software engineer decided so."`

`"The rudimentary struct and a self aware research software engineer and a vaguely scary config file could not prevent it."`

A follow up function `how()` is a current work in progress.

(Initially a project from the JuliaCon 2018 hackathon)
