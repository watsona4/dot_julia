Exercism.jl provides utility functions to solve exercises on exercism.io in interactive environments such as IJulia notebooks.

## Documentation
Running `Exercism.create_submission("exercise-name")` inside an IJulia notebook will extract all code cells marked with `# submit` and save them in a file `exercise-name.jl`. This file can then be submitted to exercism.io via the usual CLI.
